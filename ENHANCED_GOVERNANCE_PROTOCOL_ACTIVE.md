## 🔒 Enhanced Technical Specifications

### Versioning Convention (STRICT)
**Format**: `ShopLynk_Onboarding_Settings_v<MAJOR>.<MINOR>_<TAG>`

**Required Tags**:
- `v1.1_FIX` - Bug fixes and corrections
- `v1.2_UI` - Visual/UX improvements only  
- `v1.3_UPDATE` - Minor feature updates
- `v2.0_FEATURE` - New functionality or major changes
- `v[X.Y]_LOCKED` - Stable, tested, approved version

### Quality Gates (ALL REQUIRED)
Before any version can be locked:
- ✅ **Smoke test**: Landing → Onboarding Step 1 → Seller Console
- ✅ **Settings sync validation**: All 4 tabs working
- ✅ **Currency & phone format validation**: Proper formatting
- ✅ **No loops, blank pages, or broken states**: Complete flow test
- ✅ **Firebase data persistence verification**: Data saves correctly
- ✅ **Route guard behavior testing**: Authentication works

---

## 🛡️ Protected Scope (ABSOLUTE)

### 1. Landing → Onboarding → Seller Console Routing
- All route definitions and authentication guards
- CTA behavior and redirection logic
- Authentication flow state management

### 2. Onboarding Steps (ALL 3 STEPS) 
- Form schemas and validation rules
- Step progression and navigation logic
- Firebase data persistence and temporary saves
- Progress tracking and recovery mechanisms

### 3. Settings Page Management
- All 4 tabs: Store Profile, Contact & Visibility, Payments & Delivery, Account & Security
- Form validation schemas and error handling

- UI component structure and state management

### 4. Firebase Integration Dependencies

## 🚨 Rollback Protocol (IMMEDIATE ACTION)

### Triggers for Immediate Rollback:
- Onboarding process fails to complete
- Settings data not saving to Firebase
- Authentication flow failures
- Users cannot progress through required steps
- Any regression in core seller functionality
- Broken routing or navigation

### Rollback Procedure:
1. **Immediately**: Restore → `ShopLynk_Onboarding_Settings_v1.0_LOCKED`
2. **Log**: Document rollback reason in change log
3. **Notify**: Alert Senait immediately of rollback action
4. **Test**: Verify critical flows work before continuing
