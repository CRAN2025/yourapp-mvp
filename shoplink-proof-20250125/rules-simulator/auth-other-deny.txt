Test Case: Authenticated Seller Trying to Access Another Seller's Data
❌ DENIED

Path: /sellers/other-seller-123
Auth: {uid: "test-seller-2025-01", token: {...}}
Operation: read

Rule Applied: "auth != null && auth.uid == $uid"

Expected Result: ❌ Deny
Actual Result: ❌ Deny

Simulator Output:
- Path: sellers/other-seller-123
- Authentication: {uid: "test-seller-2025-01"}
- Operation: read
- Rule: auth != null (true) && auth.uid == $uid (false)
- Result: DENY

This proves cross-seller access is properly prevented.
