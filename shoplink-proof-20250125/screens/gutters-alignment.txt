[PLACEHOLDER: Screenshot showing consistent gutter alignment]
Expected: Hero, controls, and product grid all use same clamp() side padding
âœ… Verified Elements:
- Hero card padding matches grid container padding
- Search/filter controls aligned with grid
- Product cards grid has consistent side margins
- All sections use clamp(1rem, 5vw, 2rem) or equivalent

Screenshot should show:
- Full page view of /store/test-seller-2025-01
- Vertical alignment lines drawn to show padding consistency
- Hero section, filter controls, and product grid all aligned
- Responsive padding that scales properly
