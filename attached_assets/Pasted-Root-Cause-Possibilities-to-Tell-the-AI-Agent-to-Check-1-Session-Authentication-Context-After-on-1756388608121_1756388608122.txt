Root Cause Possibilities to Tell the AI Agent to Check
1. Session / Authentication Context

After onboarding, confirm the auth token and seller ID are being stored in local/session storage.

Verify the console retrieves the correct logged-in user.

Check if the app is defaulting to a generic “U” profile because the seller context is missing.

What to check:

After onboarding, inspect network calls → confirm the Authorization header is present on console requests.

Ensure the correct sellerId or userId is passed to the API.

2. Missing Profile Linking After Onboarding

Onboarding creates the seller record but may not link it to the authenticated user account.

If the API creates the seller profile but doesn’t return the sellerId to the front-end, the console can’t load the saved info.

What to check:

Confirm that the onboarding success response includes the sellerId.

Ensure the console uses this sellerId when fetching profile details.

3. Console Data Fetch Endpoint

The console might be:

Calling the wrong API endpoint for fetching seller profile data.

Using a static or default request instead of a seller-specific request.

Failing to pass the sellerId from onboarding into the GET request.

What to check:

Review the console’s GET request for /api/sellers/:id/profile.

Confirm the request URL includes the correct sellerId.

Validate that the API returns the right seller record.

4. State & Token Mismatch

If your onboarding and console flows are separate React states:

The onboarding flow sets state but doesn’t persist it in session/local storage.

On redirect, the console has no seller context → defaults to blank.

What to check:

Ensure the seller’s identity & token are stored persistently.

On console load, confirm the sellerId is loaded from session/local storage.

If using Firebase auth, verify that the UID is the same across onboarding and console.

5. UI Symptoms Matching the “U” Avatar

The “U” icon implies the console doesn’t know the logged-in seller name.

If there’s no seller data fetched, the UI renders default placeholders:

Blank settings fields.

Uninitialized avatar “U”.

This strongly indicates the console isn’t fetching the saved seller profile rather than onboarding failing.

Instructions for AI Agent to Fix

Check onboarding success response

Ensure it returns sellerId or unique profile reference.

Save sellerId in session/local storage immediately.

Verify console API request

Confirm the console calls /api/sellers/:id/profile (or equivalent).

Ensure correct sellerId and auth token are used.

Check authentication state persistence

After onboarding, verify the JWT or Firebase token is still valid.

Ensure localStorage or sessionStorage maintains identity context.

Confirm profile linking

Verify backend links user → seller profile at onboarding creation.

Fix any missing mapping on the server if needed.

Test the full flow

Sign up → onboard → redirect → console loads prefilled settings from saved data.

Summary of Problem

Onboarding saves seller data correctly but the seller console is loading in an anonymous or default state (“U” avatar, empty profile).
This happens because the saved seller profile is not being fetched or linked when landing on the console.
