What looks correct

Rules structure: publicStores/* world-readable; sellers/* private; admin gated; operators use == (not ===). 

Mirroring: profile and products mirrored to publicStores/${uid}/…; products only published when active + in stock; inactive/out-of-stock removed. 

Snapshots: public data shape matches the UI’s needs; events contain store_view, product_view, and wa_click with sensible metadata. 

Build: production build completes successfully. (Note: the build log shows a package named rest-express@1.0.0; if this is a monorepo, that’s fine—but see “Remaining artifacts” below so we can link it to a commit.) 

Must-fix (prod-hardening)
1) Lock down public events writes

Current rule allows any authenticated user (including anonymous) to write to any seller’s events/$uid. That’s okay for MVP, but it’s open to spam. Recommend tightening to: only anonymous clients, and only for sellers that actually exist in publicStores. Also validate fields.

Proposed rule patch (drop-in):

"events": {
  "$sellerId": {
    ".read": "auth != null && auth.uid == $sellerId",
    "$eid": {
      ".write": "auth != null && auth.token.sign_in_provider == 'anonymous' && root.child('publicStores').child($sellerId).exists()",
      ".validate": "
        newData.hasChildren(['type','timestamp']) &&
        newData.child('type').val().matches('^(store_view|product_view|wa_click)$') &&
        newData.child('timestamp').isNumber()
      "
    }
  }
}


This keeps your anonymous-auth approach but prevents writing to arbitrary sellers or posting junk fields. (You can relax .validate if needed.) 

2) Make mirroring a bit more resilient

Your mirroring is good; add two guards so the public tree doesn’t churn:

Preserve createdAt on product updates (don’t replace with Date.now() if you didn’t receive it).

Idempotency: read current public node and skip write if unchanged.

Example tweak (conceptual; adapt to your util):

// Before set(), optionally:
const curr = (await get(pubProdRef)).val();
if (curr && JSON.stringify(curr) === JSON.stringify(publicProduct)) return; // no-op

// When setting createdAt:
const createdAt = (curr?.createdAt ?? product.createdAt ?? Date.now());


This reduces write noise and keeps original creation timestamps intact. 

Spot-checks against your proof

publicStores profile/products include all fields your storefront needs (name, desc, price, qty, category, images, etc.). Looks good. 

Events show the three key types with sensible metadata—including a WA URL example—so your analytics pipeline should be fine once the rule is tightened. 

Rules already expose publicStores/$sellerId as readable and keep sellers/$uid private; just apply the events patch above. 

Build succeeded; bundle size warning is informational (consider code-splitting later). 

Remaining artifacts I still need to fully sign off

(These weren’t in the bundle; send them when ready—no code changes required.)

Deployed rules file after the events patch (database.rules.json). 

Commit hash for the built code (a tiny commit.txt is fine).
