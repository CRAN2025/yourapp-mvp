Instruction to AI Agent — Wrap Storefront in Console App-Shell
Objective

Render the current Storefront page inside the seller console’s global app-shell so it uses the same header/menus as Products, Orders, Analytics, and Settings. No separate preview or duplicate routes—just integrate this page into the console chrome.

Required Changes

Use the shared App-Shell

Wrap the Storefront page component with the existing app-shell (the same one used by Products, Orders, etc.).

The global header must include:

ShopLynk logo (links to /products)

Nav items: Products, Storefront, Orders, Analytics, Settings

Utilities: notifications bell, user avatar menu

Mark Storefront as the active nav item when on /storefront.

Keep the locked storefront content exactly as designed

Below the console header, render the approved (locked) banner/header section and category/search row (including Payment/Delivery chips).

Keep all locked tokens (colors, radii, elevation, motion) and styles for:

CTA (gradient family, hover/active motion)

Category pills (active gradient matches CTA)

Chips, badge, shadows, spacing

Remove redundant “Back to Dashboard” in the banner

The global header already provides navigation. If a secondary action is needed, add “View Public Store” as a small link in the banner that opens the public URL in a new tab (if applicable).

Responsiveness & Accessibility

Header is sticky with existing tokenized elevation; mobile collapses the nav to the menu.

aria-current="page" on the active Storefront nav item.

Maintain focus rings (token --focus/outline) and keyboard order: header → filters → cards.

Implementation Notes

Route: ensure /storefront renders like:

// routes/storefront.tsx
export default function StorefrontRoute() {
  return (
    <AppShell active="storefront">
      <StorefrontPage />  {/* the locked design */}
    </AppShell>
  );
}


Do not add or alter any token values—only consume the existing locked tokens.

Do not introduce any alternate header—reuse the console HeaderBar component.

Acceptance Criteria

 Visiting /storefront shows the same console header/menus as Products/Orders.

 Storefront nav is highlighted (desktop & mobile).

 The storefront banner, chips, category pills, and CTAs match the locked visuals.

 No “Back to Dashboard” button in the banner.

 Keyboard navigation + focus states work; header is sticky; layout is responsive.

That’s it—no route consolidation needed, just wrap the current page in the console shell and keep all locked styling intact
