Keep

Page header size/spacing and the current 3-up grid.

Price pill + badge styling on cards.

Search/filters block shape and elevation.

Tighten (safe tweaks)

Navbar + brand

Use the single wordmark ShopLynk everywhere (capital S + L).

Keep the small monochrome mark in the app header; avoid the big blue logo that clashed earlier.

Container + grid

Lock page width and gaps so nothing “blows up” on large screens:
container max-w-[1200px] md:max-w-[1280px] mx-auto px-6
Grid: grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 xl:grid-cols-3 gap-6 md:gap-7.

Card stability

Fix image ratio and card height so rows line up:
Image wrapper aspect-[16/9] overflow-hidden rounded-xl.
Title line-clamp-2, description/labels in a fixed stack to prevent jumpiness.

Make action row heights identical (min-h-[44px]) so buttons don’t shift.

Filters bar

Keep it one line at md+, but on small screens collapse advanced controls behind a “Filters” sheet.

Ensure the input is a consistent 56px height across pages.

Accessibility

Ensure every icon button has an aria-label (heart/favorite, kebab, copy link).

Keep visible focus rings on all interactive elements (focus:ring-brand/40).

Check the green “IN STOCK” pill contrast; use a darker text (text-emerald-800) if needed.

Performance

Images: loading="lazy" decoding="async" and set width/height attributes.

First row images can be loading="eager" to avoid LCP jank.

Theme consistency

Primary CTA (Add Product, primary actions): the brand gradient you’re already using is good—apply it only to primaries so the UI doesn’t get loud. Keep secondary buttons light/outline.

Backgrounds stay very light (your current gray-50/100), shadow at sm/md only (no heavy glassy blur on this page).

Why the prior try “broke” the UI

The header/hero scale and full-bleed container removed the page’s consistent max-width, causing giant image tiles and misaligned gutters.

Typography was bumped to display sizes on cards, which overwhelmed the layout and pushed controls off rhythm.

Developer TODO (incremental, low-risk)

 Add a Container wrapper component with max-w-[1200px] md:max-w-[1280px] mx-auto px-6.

 Wrap product images in an aspect-[16/9] div; apply object-cover.

 Add line-clamp-2 to card titles; unify action row to min-h-[44px].

 Normalize the search bar to h-14 with icon alignment and consistent padding.

 Ensure all icon buttons have aria-label and visible focus states.

 Verify contrast on status pills (green/amber/rose).

 Keep brand gradient for primary buttons only; leave the rest outline/neutral.
