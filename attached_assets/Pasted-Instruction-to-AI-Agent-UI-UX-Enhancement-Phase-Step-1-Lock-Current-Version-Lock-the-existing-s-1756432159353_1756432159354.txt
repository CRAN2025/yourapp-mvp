Instruction to AI Agent — UI/UX Enhancement Phase
Step 1 — Lock Current Version

Lock the existing stable release:

ShopLynk_Onboarding_Settings_v1.1_PRODUCT_DISPLAY


Do not make further edits to this version.

Preserve all recent fixes, missing field additions, and routing logic.

Set it as the baseline.

Step 2 — Start New Version

Create a new branch/version for this enhancement:

ShopLynk_Onboarding_Settings_v1.2_UI_UX


This version focuses only on UI and UX improvements. No functional logic should change.
Everything must look beautiful, consistent, and premium.

Step 3 — UI/UX Goals

Deliver a world-class visual experience across:

Seller Console → Product View

Public Product Cards (Summary)

Public Product Details (Full View)

Make the entire interface clean, modern, consistent, and intuitive.

Step 4 — UI/UX Improvements Required
A) Product Cards (Public Storefront)

Goals:

Elegant, clean, and premium feel

Consistent badge colors, typography, and spacing

Visual hierarchy: price → category → attributes → badges

Changes to Apply:

Unify Badge Colors

Badge Type	Color Code	Style
Stock Warning	#E63946	White bold text, all caps, ⚠️ icon
Sustainability	#2ECC71	Subtle pastel green with dark green text
Handmade / Customizable / Gift Wrap	#F5F5F5 background, neutral pastel icons	
Size / Color / Material	Use light gray background #F1F3F5, consistent font	
Category/Subcategory	Keep in dark neutral for contrast	

Typography & Labels

Use sentence case for all labels:

✅ “Eco-friendly”

❌ “eco friendly”

Consistent font weight & size across badges.

Icon & Text Alignment

Vertically center icons and labels within badges.

Ensure consistent left/right padding.

Badge Limit per Card

Show max 3–4 badges on the product card.

Prioritize most relevant:

Color

Size

Material

Handmade / Sustainability (if present)

Show all other attributes inside View Details.

“Limited Stock” Badge

Place above badges for visibility.

Consistent size & color across all products:

⚠️ LIMITED STOCK — ONLY X LEFT


Use bright red (#E63946) with bold white text.

B) Product Details (Public Full View)

Goals:

Group related information under clean sections.

Avoid clutter and maintain breathing space between sections.

New Layout Recommendations:

Top Section

Product Name + Category/Subcategory

Price in bold #27AE60 green

Limited stock badge (if applicable)

Attributes Section

Color, Size, Material badges (clean style)

Sustainability badge, if set

Special Features Section

Handmade

Customizable

Gift Wrapping

Made-to-Order

Product Policies Section

Personalization Options

Care Instructions

Warranty

Return Policy

Ships From

Occasion & Age Group Section

Show badges or grouped labels if entered.

C) Seller Console (Product View)

Goals:

Show every entered field clearly.

Use the same badge color system as the public view for consistency.

Group fields visually under sections, like:

Inventory & Pricing → Price, Quantity in Stock

Classification → Category, Subcategory

Attributes → Size, Color, Material

Features → Handmade, Customizable, Gift Wrapping

Policies → Care Instructions, Warranty, Return Policy

Step 5 — UX Rules

Do not break existing flows:

Seller onboarding

Product creation/editing

Buyer details page navigation

Use mobile-first responsive design.

Match styles across seller console and public views for a unified ShopLynk brand.

Step 6 — Testing Requirements

Before release:

Verify all badges are styled consistently.

Test across multiple categories and product variations:

Electronics

Jewelry

Fashion
(Ensure fields display only if populated)

Validate spacing, alignment, and typography on:

Desktop

Tablet

Mobile

Step 7 — Deliverables

Updated UI implemented on ShopLynk_Onboarding_Settings_v1.2_UI_UX

Side-by-side before/after screenshots for:

Seller console

Public product cards

Public product details

Confirmation that no existing functionality is broken.

Final Agent Instruction

“Lock v1.1_PRODUCT_DISPLAY and create v1.2_UI_UX.
In v1.2_UI_UX, implement a premium UI/UX refresh for product cards, seller console views, and product details pages.
Focus on badge consistency, elegant typography, clean spacing, visual hierarchy, and responsive layouts.
Keep existing data, routing, and logic intact — do not break what’s already working.”
