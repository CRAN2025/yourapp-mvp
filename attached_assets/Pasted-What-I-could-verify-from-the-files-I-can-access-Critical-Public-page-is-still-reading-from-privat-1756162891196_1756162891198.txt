What I could verify from the files I can access
❗️Critical: Public page is still reading from private paths

In your uploaded StorefrontPublic-Downloadable.tsx, the data loader fetches:

sellers/${sellerId} for the seller profile, and

sellers/${sellerId}/products for the products.
See the code that builds those refs here: ref(database, \sellers/${sellerId}`)andref(database, `sellers/${sellerId}/products`)`. 
 

With your current RTDB rules, sellers/* is private, so the public storefront would get Permission denied. The public page should read only from:

publicStores/${sellerId}/profile

publicStores/${sellerId}/products

Fix (patch exactly this file)
- const sellerRef   = ref(database, `sellers/${sellerId}`);
+ const sellerRef   = ref(database, `publicStores/${sellerId}/profile`);

- const productsRef = ref(database, `sellers/${sellerId}/products`);
+ const productsRef = ref(database, `publicStores/${sellerId}/products`);


(If this TSX is a “downloadable” variant and not the one you deploy, please confirm the deployed file reads from publicStores/*.)

✅ Good: full-bleed hero helper present

I do see the edge-to-edge FullBleedSection with the gradient band and inner max-width wrapper: that aligns with the design. 

⚠️ Minor analytics nit

handleFloatingChatClick currently logs a store_view before opening WhatsApp; that should be a wa_click (store-level) to avoid double-counting store views. The product WhatsApp handler correctly logs wa_click. 
 

Change:

- await trackInteraction({ type: 'store_view', sellerId });
+ await trackInteraction({ type: 'wa_click', sellerId });

Files I still need to review (I couldn’t find them in the upload)

The agent said “all are included,” but in what I can access I only see the storefront TSX. Please upload these so I can fully sign off:

Deployed rules

database.rules.json (exported from Firebase Console, not a snippet)

Mirroring & migration code

client/src/lib/utils/dataMirror.ts (or your actual path)

migration-script.js (or the Admin SDK script you used)

Data snapshots (JSON)

data-publicStores.json with:

publicStores/<sellerId>/profile

publicStores/<sellerId>/products (2–3 items)

data-events.json with fresh store_view and wa_click under events/<sellerId>

Build proof for this repo

build-log-fixed.txt (from npm ci && npm run build)

commit.txt (git rev-parse --short HEAD)

Playwright evidence

playwright-report.zip including:

loads /store/<sellerId> with no console errors

desktop WA button opens new tab to web.whatsapp.com/send?...

Performance + console

lighthouse-mobile.json for /store/<sellerId>
