AI Agent Governance Protocol (Full Technical Instructions)

Audience: The AI agent / developer team

Objective: Maintain absolute control over onboarding and settings flows using strict versioning and rollback procedures.

1. Scope (Protected Modules)

Landing → Onboarding → Seller Console routing

All onboarding steps, validations, and data saving

Settings page categories, store preferences, currency, language, phone validation

Firebase reads/writes linked to onboarding/settings

UI/UX tied to these flows

2. Versioning Rules

Always start a new version before making any change.

Naming convention:

ShopLynk_Onboarding_Settings_v<MAJOR>.<MINOR>_<TAG>


Examples:

v1.0_LOCKED → Stable baseline

v1.1_FIX → Bug fix

v1.2_UI → Small visual update

v2.0_FEATURE → New onboarding step

3. Change Workflow
Step 1 — Confirm Lock

If Senait requests a change, pause and confirm:

“Flows are locked. Starting vX.Y_TAG. Confirm unlock?”

Do not start unless explicitly approved.

Step 2 — Create New Version

Clone the last stable version

Name it appropriately using the convention

Work only within the new version branch

Step 3 — Implement & Test

Apply changes in isolation

Validate:

Onboarding transitions

Data-saving correctness

Settings sync

Routing behavior

UI consistency

Step 4 — Lock the New Version

If stable, tag the new version as locked:

ShopLynk_Onboarding_Settings_vX.Y_TAG_LOCKED


Update the Master Change Log.

Step 5 — Rollback Protocol

If any regression occurs:

Restore → ShopLynk_Onboarding_Settings_v(last_stable)_LOCKED


Log rollback details immediately.

4. Master Change Log

Maintain ShopLynk_Onboarding_Settings_ChangeLog.xlsx with:

Date

Version

Type (Fix/UI/Feature)

Change Summary

Requested By

Unlock Approved? (Y/N)

Developer

Status

Rollback Info

5. Communication Protocol

For every change request:

Confirm lock → request explicit unlock → start new version

Always send version ID back to Senait when done

If rollback occurs, notify Senait immediately

6. Quality Gates

Before merging or locking any new version:

Smoke test:

Landing → Onboarding step 1 → Seller Console

Check settings sync

Validate currency & phone formats

Ensure no loops, blank pages, or broken states

7. Rollback Policy

Always keep the last stable version tagged:

ShopLynk_Onboarding_Settings_vX.Y_LOCKED


Rollback immediately on regression

Document rollback in the log

Agent Checklist

 Confirm lock status

 Get explicit unlock approval

 Create new version before edits

 Implement, test, and lock

 Update the change log

 Provide version ID + PR link

 Roll back instantly if needed

Final Setup

Current Baseline:

ShopLynk_Onboarding_Settings_v1.0_LOCKED


All work must branch/tag from this or the latest locked version.
