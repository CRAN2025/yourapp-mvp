Refined Master Instruction for AI Agent (Global UI/UX Championship Quality)
Objective

Enhance the ShopLynk avatar so it:

Displays the logo at a clean, proportional, and highly visible size.

Uses a harmonized avatar background that complements the header.

Removes duplicate rendering under the "Powered by ShopLynk" tagline.

Preserves our premium glassmorphism polish and governance locks.

Key Fixes
1. Single Logo, Correct Proportion

Use only one ShopLynk logo inside the avatar.

Make the logo occupy 75% of the avatarâ€™s width, centered both vertically and horizontally.

Pull the SVG from /assets/shoplynk-logo.svg for a crisp retina-ready result.

.avatar-logo {
  width: 75%;
  height: auto;
  display: block;
  margin: 0 auto;
  object-fit: contain;
}


ðŸ”¹ Result â†’ No double logos. The brand feels intentional and visually balanced.

2. Harmonized Avatar Background

Keep a subtle, frosted-glass effect but darker than the header so the logo pops.

Suggested base tone: rgba(250, 250, 255, 0.6), slightly more opaque than the header.

.avatar-container {
  background: rgba(250, 250, 255, 0.6);
  backdrop-filter: blur(12px);
  box-shadow: 0 4px 20px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.05);
  border-radius: 50%;
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
}


ðŸ”¹ Result â†’ The ShopLynk logo will stand out crisply without making the avatar visually heavier.

3. Powered-by Tagline Fix

Remove any secondary rendering of the ShopLynk SVG inside the "Powered by ShopLynk" text line.

Keep the tagline clean and aligned.

.powered-by {
  font-size: 13px;
  font-weight: 500;
  color: #6B7280; /* soft gray */
  margin-top: 2px;
  display: inline-block;
}

4. Governance Compliance

âœ… Lock product cards (v1.3.1_UI_UX_WHATSAPP_PER_CARD)

âœ… Lock seller console (v1.7_SELLER_CONSOLE_PREMIUM_POLISH)

âœ… Lock WhatsApp integrations (v1.9 reserved)

âœ… Safe to update public storefront header only

Expected Outcome

ShopLynk logo is now crisp, perfectly scaled, and dominant enough to establish trust.

No double logos, no blurriness.

Avatar background integrates seamlessly with the header, keeping things premium and balanced.

"Powered by ShopLynk" tagline is subtle, clean, and secondary â€” not fighting the logo.
