AI IMPLEMENTATION INSTRUCTION
Scope: v1.9_PUBLIC_STORE_ULTRA_PREMIUM

Objective: Transform the public storefront into a world-class, visually cohesive, ultra-premium experience while maintaining locked governance on seller console, product cards, and WhatsApp integrations.

Governance Rules üîí (DO NOT BREAK)

DO NOT modify product cards (v1.3.1_UI_UX_WHATSAPP_PER_CARD is locked).

DO NOT modify the seller console (v1.7_SELLER_CONSOLE_PREMIUM_POLISH is locked).

DO NOT modify WhatsApp integration logic (reserved for v1.9.5).

All updates must be scoped to the public storefront header + filters.

Mobile responsiveness must be maintained and tested.

Core Design Direction üé®

We‚Äôre designing as if we‚Äôre competing at a global UI/UX championship:

Minimalist Luxury ‚Üí Clean, spacious, frictionless browsing.

Landing Page Harmony ‚Üí Use ShopLynk Blue (#2563EB) as the primary accent with whites & soft neutrals for the base.

Premium Depth ‚Üí Elevate the header, filters, and search with glass morphism, subtle shadows, and layer separation.

Scalable Identity ‚Üí The design must look just as elegant on small shops as it does on multi-category storefronts.

Header Enhancements üèÜ
1. Full-Width Immersive Header

Header now stretches edge-to-edge, matching filter bar alignment exactly.

Background:

Use a layered gradient ‚Üí

From: #F8FAFF (soft white top)
To: rgba(37, 99, 235, 0.08) (~8% ShopLynk Blue overlay)


Gives a clean, airy feel vs the heavy purple block.

2. Store Avatar & Branding

Avatar: Larger 96px circle with soft neon ring glow (rgba(37, 99, 235, 0.35)).

Title: Bold, elevated typography (font-weight: 800, #111827 for better contrast).

Subtitle (‚ÄúOnline Store‚Äù): Reduce size, use #6B7280 for subtle hierarchy.

3. Action Pills ("Payment Methods", "Delivery Options")

Convert pills into glass-style buttons:

Background: rgba(255,255,255,0.6) with backdrop blur.

Hover: Slight scale-up (1.04x) + blue shadow glow.

Icons: Retain minimal SVG icons but update fill to #2563EB.

4. Back to Dashboard Button

Premium gradient:

From: #2563EB ‚Üí To: #3B82F6


Add subtle elevation + hover depth shadow.

Filter & Search Bar Polish ‚ú®
1. Search Bar

Apply glass morphism:

Background: rgba(255,255,255,0.55)

Backdrop blur: blur(16px)

Inner shadow: Soft rgba(0,0,0,0.03)

On focus: Animate glowing blue ring #2563EB.

2. Category Pills

Default state: Soft-neutral background (#F3F4F6), text #374151.

Active state:

Full ShopLynk Blue background (#2563EB).

White bold text, soft drop shadow for premium click feel.

3. Sort + Favorites

Keep alignment consistent.

Replace old gray badge with pill-style soft red badge (#F43F5E with opacity 85%).

Hover glow to make it pop subtly without distraction.

Page-Wide Visual Balance üåø

Reduce purple dominance ‚Äî switch from heavy purple backgrounds ‚Üí airy white-first, blue-accent design.

Introduce elevated shadows to create separation between header, filters, and content.

Background gradient for body:

From: #FFFFFF
To: #F8FAFC


‚Üí Matches the landing page‚Äôs light, breathable tone.
