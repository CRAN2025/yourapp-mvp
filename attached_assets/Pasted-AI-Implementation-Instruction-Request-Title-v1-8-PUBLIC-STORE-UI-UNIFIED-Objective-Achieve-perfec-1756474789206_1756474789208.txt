AI Implementation Instruction

Request Title: v1.8_PUBLIC_STORE_UI_UNIFIED
Objective: Achieve perfect alignment by making the store header box and the filter/search bar container full-width, matching the gradient background edge-to-edge while preserving governance locks.

Step-by-Step Implementation
1. Header Box (Store Info Section)

Current Issue: The header content box is narrower than the gradient background due to max-width constraints.

Required Fix:

Set the header container to:

width: 100%;
max-width: 100%;


Maintain consistent internal padding for large screens:

padding-left: 1.5rem; /* px-6 */
padding-right: 1.5rem;
@media (min-width: 768px) {
  padding-left: 3rem; /* md:px-12 */
  padding-right: 3rem;
}


Keep the gradient background unchanged â€” this adjustment is for the content inside.

2. Search & Filter Bar Container

Current Issue: The search/filter bar container is slightly wider than the header box but still not edge-to-edge.

Required Fix:

Apply the exact same full-width rule:

width: 100%;
max-width: 100%;


Use matching responsive paddings so it visually aligns perfectly with the header box.

3. Maintain Visual Hierarchy

Ensure the gradient background stays full-bleed.

Ensure header + filter sections span the same width.

Ensure equal padding and spacing on all screen sizes for symmetry.

No shadows or background changes are introduced â€” keep current styles, only expand width.

4. Preserve Governance Locks ðŸ”’
