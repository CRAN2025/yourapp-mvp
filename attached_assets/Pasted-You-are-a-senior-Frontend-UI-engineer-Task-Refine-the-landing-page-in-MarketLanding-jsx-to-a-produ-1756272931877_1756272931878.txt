You are a senior Frontend/UI engineer.
Task: Refine the landing page in MarketLanding.jsx to a production-ready, responsive, accessible, conversion-focused design—without changing app routes, copy, or analytics hooks. Keep the “glass” aesthetic, but make spacing, alignment, and card sizing consistent.

Hard requirements

Structure & Scope

Modify only MarketLanding.jsx and inline styles it contains. If you must add tiny utilities, define them inside the same file.

Do not add dependencies or change routes/links.

Demo Store Grid (inside PreviewDevice)

Desktop/tablet: 2 columns, gap 12px; Mobile < 520px: 1 column.

Each demo card has fixed height 200px; inner image area 92px tall with 12px radius.

Button (“Contact on WhatsApp”): 36px height, full width, stays pinned to bottom using a flex column container.

Ensure no layout shift between cards; titles wrap max 2 lines then ellipsis.

CTAs (header + hero + mid-page)

Use a single unified style: height 52px, radius 16px, bold label 16px, consistent padding.

Primary gradient = existing brand gradient; Secondary = transparent with 1.5px border.

Typography & Spacing

Heading scale: H1 clamp(40px, 7vw, 64px); section titles 24px; body 16–18px.

Vertical rhythm: 6/8/12/16/20/24 increments; no “odd” gaps.

Accessibility

WCAG 2.2 AA contrast for text on glass backgrounds.

Keyboard focus visible and consistent; :focus-visible outlines on buttons/links.

Respect prefers-reduced-motion: disable transitions/IO observers gracefully.

All interactive elements have clear labels and aria where needed.

Performance

No new fonts or network calls.

Avoid layout trashing (e.g., expensive on scroll). IntersectionObserver OK with cleanup.

Output

Return a complete, drop-in MarketLanding.jsx with only the necessary changes.

Include a short “Changes & Rationale” list at the top as comments.

Acceptance tests

On 390px, 768px, and 1200px screens: CTAs have identical height/shape; demo cards align with equal heights; button pinned bottom; no overflow.

prefers-reduced-motion removes animations but keeps layout intact.

Lighthouse a11y passes color-contrast checks on glass surfaces.

No console warnings; no layout shift when images load (reserve space).

Important: Preserve copy, routes, tracking calls, and class names used by analytics. Do not introduce Tailwind or external CSS files. Keep styles inline as in the original file.

Bonus: Tiny style tokens you/agent can reuse

Radii: card 16px, hero 24px, button 16px, image 12px

Shadows: 0 10px 30px rgba(15, 23, 42, .08) (base), 0 30px 80px rgba(15,23,42,.18) (hover/hero)

Focus: outline: 2px solid #5a6bff; outline-offset: 2px;

Gaps: 6, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24 px only
