# ShopLynk.app — Privacy Policy
**Last Updated:** August 24, 2025

This Privacy Policy explains how **ShopLynk.app** (“**ShopLynk**,” “**Company**,” “**we**,” “**us**,” or “**our**”) collects, uses, discloses, and safeguards personal information when you use our websites, dashboards, and services that enable sellers to create message‑based storefronts and interact with buyers via WhatsApp or other messaging channels (collectively, the “**Platform**”).

By using the Platform, you agree to this Privacy Policy and to any region‑specific notices referenced here. If you do not agree, please do not use the Platform.

**Controller / Contact.** Unless stated otherwise, **ShopLynk** is a controller of personal information it collects via the Platform. Contact: **[ShopLynk Technologies Inc./Ltd.]**, **[registered address, city, country]**, **[legal@shoplynk.app]**. If you are in the EEA/UK, we may appoint an EU/UK representative (see regional addendum).

> This document is a strong baseline for global compliance (Canada/US/EU/UK/Brazil and more) and should be tailored by qualified counsel for the markets you target.

## 1) Who This Policy Covers & Our Roles
- **Sellers (Merchants):** Individuals or businesses that create storefronts and message with Buyers. Sellers are **independent controllers** of Buyer data they collect directly (e.g., via WhatsApp). ShopLynk may also act as a **processor/service provider** for certain features (e.g., hosting your product catalog, analytics about your storefront). See Section 10 and the **Data Processing Addendum (DPA)** if we process data on your behalf.
- **Buyers:** Individuals who browse storefronts and contact Sellers.
- **Visitors:** Individuals who visit our sites or marketing pages.

---

## 2) Personal Information We Collect
We collect the following categories of personal information, which may vary by user type and region:

1. **Account & Profile Data** (Sellers and, if applicable, Buyers): name, email, phone, username, business details (legal name, address, tax numbers), role, profile photo, storefront name/URL, and preferences.
2. **Storefront Content** (Sellers): product listings, images, descriptions, pricing, inventory, shipping options, return policies, branding (logos, trade names), and any content you upload.
3. **Communications & Support**: emails, chat messages with us, support tickets, feedback, surveys, and related metadata.
4. **Messaging Events (WhatsApp or similar)**: click‑to‑message events, timestamps, and routing metadata generated through our buttons or links. **We do not read or store your message content** exchanged on third‑party services like WhatsApp unless we explicitly provide an in‑app messaging feature (if we do, we will describe it here).
5. **Device/Usage Data**: IP address, device/browser type, OS version, language, referral URLs, pages viewed, session data, approximate location (from IP), identifiers (e.g., cookies, SDK IDs), and diagnostics/analytics about how you use the Platform.
6. **Payments & Billing (Sellers)**: If we provide paid subscriptions or services, we collect billing details (billing contact, address, VAT/GST IDs). If a third‑party processor is used, your payment card details are collected **directly** by that processor (we do not store full card numbers).
7. **Fraud/Abuse Signals**: logs, risk flags, and information from service providers to prevent spam, fraud, and misuse.
8. **Recruiting & Business Contacts** (if you apply or partner with us): application materials, CVs, and business contact information.

**Sensitive Personal Information.** We do not seek to collect sensitive information (e.g., government ID numbers, precise geolocation, health/biometric data). Do not send sensitive data over messaging unless required by law and appropriately secured.

**Children.** The Platform is not intended for children under 13 (or older, where local law requires). We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. See Section 12.

---

## 3) Sources of Personal Information
- **Directly from you**: registration, storefront setup, uploads, communications.
- **Automatically**: cookies, SDKs, server logs, analytics.
- **From third parties**: identity verification vendors, payment processors, fraud prevention partners, advertising/analytics partners (where permitted), and messaging platforms (event metadata only).
- **From Sellers**: if you are a Buyer and a Seller provides information to us for a feature we power on the Seller’s behalf (see Section 10).

---

## 4) How We Use Personal Information (Purposes & Legal Bases)
We use personal information for:

- **Providing and improving the Platform** (account creation, hosting, catalog tools, analytics, troubleshooting, personalization).  
  - *Legal bases (EEA/UK):* Contract; Legitimate interests (to run and improve services).  
- **Security, fraud prevention, and integrity** (monitoring abuse, protecting accounts and Platform, enforcing policies).  
  - *Legal bases:* Legitimate interests; Legal obligation.  
- **Communications** (service/transactional emails, onboarding messages, important updates).  
  - *Legal bases:* Contract; Legitimate interests.  
- **Marketing (our services)** such as newsletters or promotions, subject to consent requirements (e.g., **CASL** in Canada, **ePrivacy** in EEA). You can unsubscribe at any time.  
  - *Legal bases:* Consent; Legitimate interests where permitted.  
- **Compliance with laws** (tax, accounting, regulatory inquiries, sanctions/export controls).

## 5) Cookies, SDKs & Analytics
We use cookies and similar technologies (pixels, SDKs, local storage) to: keep you signed in, remember preferences, measure performance, and, where permitted, help us market our services. You can manage cookies in your browser settings and (where available) via our **Cookie Preferences** link. Some features may not function without certain cookies.

## 6) Disclosures of Personal Information
We disclose personal information to:
- **Service Providers / Processors**: hosting, storage, analytics, email/messaging, customer support, fraud prevention, security, identity verification, payment processing, and professional advisors. These providers are bound by contracts limiting their use of your information.
- **Sellers**: If you are a Buyer and interact with a Seller, we may pass along necessary information that you intentionally submit for that interaction (e.g., your contact details when you request contact). **Sellers are independent controllers** of the data they receive.
- **Affiliates**: within our corporate group for purposes consistent with this Policy.
- **Legal/Compliance**: to comply with law, respond to lawful requests, protect rights, safety, and property, and enforce our agreements/policies.
- **Business Transfers**: as part of a merger, financing, acquisition, or sale of assets. We will notify you where required.
- **With Consent**: where you direct us to share information.

We do **not** sell your personal information for money. We may engage in **“sharing”** for cross‑context behavioral advertising as defined under the California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA); see Section 11 and the California Notice for opt‑out rights.

---

## 7) International Data Transfers
We operate globally. Your personal information may be transferred to and processed in countries other than your own, which may have different data protection laws. Where required, we use lawful transfer mechanisms (e.g., **Standard Contractual Clauses**) and implement appropriate safeguards. Details may be provided upon request.

---

## 8) Data Retention
We retain personal information as long as needed for the purposes described here, to comply with legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce agreements. Retention periods vary based on data type, account status, legal requirements, and our legitimate business needs. When no longer needed, data is deleted or anonymized.

---

## 9) Security
We implement technical and organizational measures designed to protect personal information (e.g., encryption in transit, access controls, audit logging). However, no system is 100% secure. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account credentials and for securing your devices.

---

## 10) Our Role to Sellers: Processor / Service Provider
For certain features, ShopLynk acts as a **processor** (EU/UK) or **service provider/contractor** (US/California) on behalf of Sellers, who are controllers of their Buyer data. When acting as a processor, we process personal information **solely** under the Seller’s instructions and our **Data Processing Addendum (DPA)**, which includes required terms (e.g., SCCs for international transfers). If you are a Seller, ensure your own privacy notice accurately describes your processing and your use of ShopLynk.
