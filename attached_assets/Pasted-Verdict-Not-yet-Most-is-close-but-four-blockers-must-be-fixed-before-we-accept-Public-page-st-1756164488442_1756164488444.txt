Verdict

Not yet ✅. Most is close, but four blockers must be fixed before we accept:

Public page still reads private paths.

Store WA click is tracked as store_view (should be wa_click).

Favorites key is global, not per-store.

Realtime DB events rule still allows any authenticated user to write to any seller.

Below I show exactly where, why, and how to fix.

1) Public storefront is fetching from sellers/* (private)

Your deployed component loads the seller and products from the private tree:

sellers/${sellerId} (seller) and

sellers/${sellerId}/products (products).
See lines loading data with ref(database, ...). 
 

Fix (exact diff):

- const sellerRef = ref(database, `sellers/${sellerId}`);
+ const sellerRef = ref(database, `publicStores/${sellerId}/profile`);

- const productsRef = ref(database, `sellers/${sellerId}/products`);
+ const productsRef = ref(database, `publicStores/${sellerId}/products`);


Your public snapshots are already in the right place (publicStores/<sellerId>/profile and /products) so switching the reads will align with your rules. 
 

2) Store-level WhatsApp click is tracked as store_view

In the store contact CTA you’re logging store_view instead of wa_click. That will inflate view counts. 

Fix:

- await trackInteraction({ type: 'store_view', sellerId });
+ await trackInteraction({ type: 'wa_click', sellerId });


(Product-level WA clicks already use wa_click — keep that.) 

3) Favorites are not scoped per store

LocalStorage key is shoplink_favorites (global), so favorites from one store bleed into another. 
 

Fix:

// on load
- const saved = localStorage.getItem('shoplink_favorites');
+ const favKey = `shoplink_favorites_${sellerId}`;
+ const saved = localStorage.getItem(favKey);

// on save
- localStorage.setItem('shoplink_favorites', JSON.stringify(Array.from(newFavorites)));
+ localStorage.setItem(favKey, JSON.stringify(Array.from(newFavorites)));

4) RTDB events rule is too open

Current rule: ".write": "auth != null" at /events/$uid. Any signed-in user (including anon) can write to any seller node. 

Hardened rule (drop-in):

"events": {
  "$sellerId": {
    ".read": "auth != null && auth.uid == $sellerId",
    "$eid": {
      ".write": "auth != null && auth.token.sign_in_provider == 'anonymous' && root.child('publicStores').child($sellerId).exists()",
      ".validate": "
        newData.hasChildren(['type','timestamp']) &&
        newData.child('type').val().matches('^(store_view|product_view|wa_click)$') &&
        newData.child('timestamp').isNumber()
      "
    }
  }
}


This keeps anonymous writes for analytics but prevents cross-tenant spam.

Design alignment nits (quick wins)
A) Sticky header on public view

The public storefront header is sticky: className="... sticky top-0 ...". Our spec for the public storefront was non-sticky. Remove sticky top-0 z-40 .... 

Fix:

- <div className="bg-background border-b sticky top-0 z-40 backdrop-blur-sm bg-background/95">
+ <div className="bg-background border-b">

B) Full-bleed hero is good — keep it

You already ship a proper full-bleed section using the edge-to-edge band with inner clamp; that matches the design. 

Mirroring util — small hardening (optional but recommended)

Your mirroring works (active + qty>0 go public; else remove). It sets createdAt if missing, but does not preserve on subsequent updates and doesn’t skip identical writes. 
 

Suggested tweak (conceptual):

// before set(pubProdRef, publicProduct):
const curr = (await get(pubProdRef)).val();
const createdAt = curr?.createdAt ?? product.createdAt ?? Date.now();
const publicProduct = { ...computed, createdAt, updatedAt: Date.now() };

if (curr && JSON.stringify(curr) === JSON.stringify(publicProduct)) return; // idempotent no-op
await set(pubProdRef, publicProduct);
