AI Agent Implementation Instructions (With Governance)
Objective

Unify the storefront UI and landing page design language under a single icy-blue SaaS theme for a premium, enterprise-grade look.

Step 1 — Color & Gradient Updates

Update the storefront theme to match the landing page:

Header Background Gradient:

Start: #EEF3FF

End: #F8FBFF

Primary Button Gradient:

Start: #3B82F6

End: #60A5FA

Shadow: rgba(59, 130, 246, 0.25) blur 6px.

Secondary Pills / Filter Chips:

Base: #F3F8FE

Active Text: #1E40AF

Inactive Text: #6B7280

Powered by ShopLynk brand blue: #2563EB

Overall Elevation Style: Keep soft frosted shadows (rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.04)) for cards and buttons for depth.

Step 2 — Logo Container Treatment

Maintain square container.

Apply a subtle inner shadow to differentiate from header background, using:
box-shadow: inset 0 0 12px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.03).

Maintain proportional scaling:

Default: 64px height

Scales dynamically based on screen size for better consistency across devices.

Keep logo background aligned with header hues; no harsh contrasts.

Step 3 — Typography & Hierarchy Lock

Store Name ("Grow Up") → font-weight: 700; font-size: 1.75rem; color: #111827

Powered by ShopLynk → font-weight: 500; font-size: 0.95rem; color: #2563EB

Online Store → font-weight: 400; font-size: 0.85rem; color: #6B7280

Ensure line-heights remain consistent across breakpoints.

Step 4 — Governance & Safety Rules

Why governance matters: These changes affect core storefront visuals, so we must isolate style updates from seller data and console logic.

Rules for Implementation

Do NOT modify seller data flows:

Onboarding

Product uploads

Order processing

WhatsApp integration
→ All business logic remains untouched.

Isolate style variables into a theme config file:

No hard-coded colors in components.

No overrides inside console-specific screens.

Do NOT alter landing page marketing analytics hooks.

Regression check:

After implementation, confirm that authenticated vs unauthenticated flows remain unaffected.

Verify that public store views still inherit branding safely.

Step 5 — Deliverable Checklist for Agent

 Update color tokens & gradients.

 Align buttons, pills, and cards with icy-blue SaaS styling.

 Apply proportional logo sizing rules.

 Lock header typography & hierarchy.

 Test across:

Desktop, tablet, mobile

Light & dark rendering modes

Multi-seller stores.

Final Result

Storefront → Matches landing page in mood and visual identity.

Unified branding = premium, trustworthy, scalable.

Minimal code risk since business logic, seller data, and onboarding remain untouched.
