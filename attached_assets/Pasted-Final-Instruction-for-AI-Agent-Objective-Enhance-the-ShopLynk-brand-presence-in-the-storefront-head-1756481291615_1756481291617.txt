Objective

Enhance the ShopLynk brand presence in the storefront header by:

Dynamically scaling the ShopLynk logo.

Harmonizing the avatar background with the header design.

Preserving the glass-morphism premium polish.

Maintaining governance locks across other components.

Implementation Details
1. Dynamic Logo Scaling (Proportional to Avatar)

Logo size should always occupy 70% of the avatarâ€™s diameter.

Use the ShopLynk SVG from /assets/shoplynk-logo.svg for crispness.

.avatar-logo {
  width: 70%;
  height: auto;
  display: block;
  margin: 0 auto;
}


ðŸ”¹ Why: Ensures the ShopLynk logo is visually authoritative and always scales perfectly across devices.

2. Harmonized Avatar Background

Keep the frosted-glass glassmorphism effect but slightly increase contrast so the ShopLynk logo is visible.

Match avatar background tone to the header background, but make it one shade darker for depth.

.avatar-container {
  background: rgba(250, 250, 255, 0.7);
  backdrop-filter: blur(14px);
  box-shadow: 0 4px 20px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.08);
  border-radius: 50%;
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
}


ðŸ”¹ Result: The ShopLynk logo pops, while still blending naturally into the premium header aesthetic.

3. Adaptive Responsiveness

On mobile (<480px): Reduce avatar to 68px while maintaining 70% logo ratio.

On desktop: Avatar fixed at 88px for balanced header hierarchy.

On 4K/Retina: Maintain SVG scaling for pixel-perfect rendering.

4. Governance Compliance

âœ… LOCKED â†’ Product cards untouched (v1.3.1_UI_UX_WHATSAPP_PER_CARD)
âœ… LOCKED â†’ Seller console untouched (v1.7_SELLER_CONSOLE_PREMIUM_POLISH)
âœ… LOCKED â†’ WhatsApp integrations reserved for v1.9
âœ… SAFE TO UPDATE â†’ Public storefront header only.

Expected Result

ShopLynk logo is now crisp, proportional, and visually dominant without feeling heavy.

Avatar background seamlessly integrates with the header, elevating brand trust.

Design stays premium, minimal, and marketplace-ready.

Fully responsive and retina-ready.
