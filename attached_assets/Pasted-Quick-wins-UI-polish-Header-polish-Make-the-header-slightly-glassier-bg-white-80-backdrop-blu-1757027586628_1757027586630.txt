Quick wins (UI polish)

Header polish

Make the header slightly “glassier”: bg-white/80 backdrop-blur supports-[backdrop-filter]:bg-white/60 border-b border-slate-200.

Add a subtle shadow only on scroll.

Active tab

Keep the pill but bump contrast: text-slate-900 bg-slate-100 rounded-lg px-3 py-1.5.

Card bars alignment

Ensure price bar and stock pill share the same baseline on every card (items-center gap-2 on the row).

Chips consistency

Categories (e.g., Electronics, Jewelry & Accessories) = neutral/outline.

Attributes (Eco-friendly, Gift Wrap, Handmade, Customizable) = soft fills.

Standardize spacing: gap-2 between rows, gap-1.5 within a row.

Card footers

Equalize footer height so Edit/Preview/Copy Link align across cards. E.g., give the meta block a small min-h so varying text lengths don’t push buttons around.

Button/icon ergonomics

32px hit area for icon buttons (heart/favorite).

Add title/aria-label to Edit/Preview/Copy Link for a11y.

Numbers & currency

Use your formatPrice everywhere (you already do).

Format counters with Intl.NumberFormat (e.g., 100 views · 3 sold) and show — for zero (instead of 0 sold) if you want a softer look.

Image perf

Add srcSet/sizes, loading="lazy", decoding="async", and a fixed aspect-[4/3] to prevent layout shift.

Favorites filter chip

Keep visual parity with other filter controls (same height/pill radius). Disabled state = reduced opacity + no shadow.
