# ShopLynk.app — Terms of Use
**Last Updated:** August 24, 2025

These Terms of Use (“**Terms**”) govern your access to and use of ShopLynk.app’s websites, dashboards, tools, and services that enable sellers to create message-based storefronts and interact with buyers via WhatsApp or other messaging channels (collectively, the “**Platform**”). By accessing or using the Platform, you agree to these Terms and policies incorporated by reference (the “**Agreement**”). If you do not agree, do not use the Platform.

**Parties.** “**Company**,” “**ShopLynk.app**,” “**we**,” “**us**,” or “**our**” means **[ShopLynk Technologies Inc./Ltd.]**, **[registered address, city, country]**. “**You**” means the person or entity using the Platform. “**Seller**” means an account that lists or sells goods/services. “**Buyer**” means an account that browses or purchases from a Seller.

> **Note:** This template is a strong baseline but not legal advice. Have qualified counsel adapt it for every country/region you target.
