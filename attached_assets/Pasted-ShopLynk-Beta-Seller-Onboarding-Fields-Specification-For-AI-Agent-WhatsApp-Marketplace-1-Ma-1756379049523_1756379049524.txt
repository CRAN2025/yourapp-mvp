These fields must be collected during signup to activate the seller profile.

Store / Business Name	Text	Public-facing shop name	Must be unique.
WhatsApp Number	Phone	Buyer contact + product inquiries	Core to the model; drives communication.
Email Address	Email	Login + notifications	Also used for subscription tracking.
Country	Dropdown	Segmentation, default currency, and payment options	Preload African countries, allow global expansion later.
Business Category	Dropdown	Organizes shops into categories	Examples: Food, Fashion, Decor, Electronics, Services.
Subscription Plan	Dropdown	Track beta vs. future tiers	Default = Beta Free Plan.
2. Optional Fields (Enhance Seller Profile)

Collected but not required to publish the store during beta. Sellers can update later.

Field	Data Type	Purpose
Store Logo	Image	Branding
Store Banner	Image	Visual storefront identity
Short Store Bio / About	Text	Quick intro for buyers
Social Media Handles	Links	Cross-promotion: Instagram, TikTok, Facebook
Preferred Language	Dropdown	For localized store display

Operating Hours	Time range	For service-based sellers
Tags / Keywords	Multi-text	Improve discoverability in search
3. Payment Methods (Display-Only in Beta)

ShopLynk will not process payments in beta, but sellers can display supported payment options to buyers.
These methods must reflect common African payment systems.

Payment Method	Regions Where Common	Notes
Mobile Money (M-Pesa, Airtel Money, MTN MoMo, Orange Money)	Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania, Ghana, Zambia, Rwanda	Most widely used; high adoption.
Bank Transfer	All regions	Seller provides details manually.
Cash on Delivery (COD)	Nigeria, Kenya, Ghana	Critical for low-trust buyers.
Card Payments (seller-managed)	South Africa, Nigeria, Ghana	Through external gateways (Flutterwave, Paystack, Stripe).
PayPal (optional)	International sellers	Optional, not widely adopted locally.
Other Local Wallets	Country-specific	e.g., EcoCash (Zimbabwe), Wave (Senegal).

Implementation Note:

Sellers select one or more payment methods from a predefined list.

Buyers see these methods displayed but ShopLynk does not handle payment routing in beta.

4. Delivery Options (Seller-Managed in Beta)

Sellers specify how they handle delivery; ShopLynk only displays the options to buyers.

Delivery Option	Purpose	Notes
In-Store Pickup	Buyer collects item directly	Optional.
Local Delivery	Seller-managed delivery within city or region	Seller can set delivery fees manually.
National Courier Service	Use countrywide courier services	Examples: DHL Express, GIG Logistics, Aramex, Posta Kenya.
International Shipping	For cross-border buyers	Optional; sellers must provide their own rates.

Implementation Note:

Sellers choose available delivery methods during onboarding or later in store settings.

Shipping fees remain seller-defined and are not automated in beta.

5. Key Design Rules for Beta

Frictionless Signup: Only the mandatory fields above are required.

Flexible Profile Enrichment: Sellers can add branding, payment methods, and delivery info after activation.

Buyer Transparency: Payment methods and delivery options are visible but ShopLynk does not manage checkout.

Future-Proofing: We can layer subscription tiers and premium store customizations post-beta without disrupting existing sellers.
