Instruction to AI Agent

Objective: Implement the Hybrid Avatar Strategy for ShopLynk’s public storefront while maintaining premium aesthetics and marketplace trust.

Scope

File(s): Public storefront header & store info components only.

Version: v1.9.2_UI_PUBLIC_STORE_PREMIUM_POLISH.

Assets: Use existing ShopLynk gradient logo in /assets/logos/shoplynk-logo.svg as fallback.

Preserve:

Product cards (v1.3.1_UI_UX_WHATSAPP_PER_CARD) LOCKED

Seller Console Premium Polish (v1.7) LOCKED

WhatsApp integration routing LOCKED

Implementation Details
1. Avatar Strategy

If Seller Avatar Exists → Display seller’s custom logo/avatar.

If No Avatar Uploaded → Display ShopLynk’s gradient logo as fallback.

Avatar size: 96px (circular, crisp, high-DPI ready).

Subtle 1px border around avatar (#E5E7EB) with soft outer shadow for visual lift.

Keep avatar aligned left as it is today.

2. “Powered by ShopLynk” Badge

Below the store name, add a tiny branding badge:

Badge text: “Powered by ShopLynk”

Left-aligned under the store name.

Use ShopLynk’s official logo icon (from /assets/logos/shoplynk-logo.svg).

Typography:

Font: Inter, 12px

Weight: medium

Color: #6B7280 (neutral gray).

Badge background: transparent (no pill), for premium minimalism.

Hover state: Light fade-in animation to 90% opacity.

3. Header Layout & Aesthetics

Maintain the current soft-white / neutral gradient header introduced in v1.9.1.

Keep consistent 8px rounded corners on avatar + container.

Adjust vertical spacing: Add 8px breathing room above and below the avatar block for better balance.

Match visual language with the landing page gradient treatment:

Light, airy feel (avoid heavy purples or overly saturated blues).

Aim for elevated minimalism consistent with premium marketplaces.

4. Fallback Logic

If the seller uploads a low-quality avatar (e.g., < 200x200px resolution):

Auto-upscale with shadow & blur fallback layer to maintain visual quality.

If the avatar cannot be fetched → Default to ShopLynk gradient logo immediately.

Governance & Locks

LOCKED: Product cards → v1.3.1_UI_UX_WHATSAPP_PER_CARD (don’t touch)

LOCKED: Seller console → v1.7_SELLER_CONSOLE_PREMIUM_POLISH

LOCKED: WhatsApp integration flows reserved for v1.9.4

All avatar logic applies only to public storefront headers.

Final Deliverable

When implemented correctly, the public storefront header will:

Show seller’s branding prominently when available.

Fall back gracefully to ShopLynk’s premium logo when no avatar is set.

Subtly reinforce ShopLynk’s marketplace identity using the “Powered by ShopLynk” badge.

Maintain visual harmony with the landing page’s premium, light aesthetic.
