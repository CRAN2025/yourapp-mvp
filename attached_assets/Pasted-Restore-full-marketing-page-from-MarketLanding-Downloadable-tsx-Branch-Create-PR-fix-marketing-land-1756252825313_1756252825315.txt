Restore full marketing page from MarketLanding-Downloadable.tsx
Branch

Create PR fix/marketing-landing-restore.

What to do

Move & normalize the component

Source file: ~/workspace/MarketLanding-Downloadable.tsx

Create new page: ~/workspace/client/src/pages/MarketingLanding.tsx

Copy the component into that file and:

Export default MarketingLanding.

Replace any absolute/incorrect imports with project-local imports.

Ensure all assets used (images/icons) exist under client/public or client/src/assets. If they’re outside, move them and update paths.

Wire the home route to the page

File: ~/workspace/client/src/main.tsx or wherever React Router is configured.

Set / route to render <MarketingLanding />.

Keep all existing app routes (/app, /store/:sellerId, etc.) unchanged.

CTA links (do not change behavior)

Confirm all “Create Store”, “Start Free”, “Sign in” buttons link to:

Create/Start → /app (or your current sign-up route if different)

Sign in → /app (or your current sign-in route)

Use <Link to="/app"> (React Router) rather than hardcoding absolute URLs.

Styling + layout

Verify Tailwind (or CSS) classes compile and render correctly.

Remove any dead inline styles/imports that aren’t needed.

Make sure the page is responsive (no horizontal scroll on mobile).

Keep bundling healthy

Ensure no server-only imports are pulled into the page (avoid importing anything from server/**).

No dynamic eval or window.require.

Page should tree-shake down to client-side assets only.

404 fallthrough

Keep /index.html SPA fallback (already covered by hosting rewrites). The landing page is only /.

Build + Deploy (do not change hosting config)

cd ~/workspace/client
npm ci
npm run build
cd ..
firebase use yourapp-mvp
firebase deploy --only hosting --project yourapp-mvp

Acceptance criteria

https://yourapp-mvp.web.app/ renders the full marketing page (from the old design), not the minimal placeholder.

CTAs navigate correctly (/app etc.) with the SPA still working after hard refresh.

No red errors in DevTools Console on /.

DevTools Network shows CSS/JS from /assets/* loading with status 200.

Lighthouse on /: Performance ≥ 85, Accessibility ≥ 90 (attach screenshot).

Deep link still works: https://yourapp-mvp.web.app/store/<sellerId> renders (proves rewrites not broken).

Deliverables

Rollback

If anything regresses after deploy, revert to the previous release in Firebase Hosting → Release History and ping me on the PR.

If you discover that MarketLanding-Downloadable.tsx contains mixed server/client code or legacy imports, don’t refactor features. Instead:

Extract only the presentational/interactive client parts into MarketingLanding.tsx.

Leave a TODO in the PR for any non-blocking items you parked.
