Storefront Public View — Go/No-Go QA Checklist
1) Hero band (edge-to-edge)

 Full-bleed gradient spans 100% width at all breakpoints (no boxed margins).

 Hero card stays centered with max-width and rounded corners.

 No horizontal scrollbars (320–1920px).
How to test: Resize browser; check iPhone Safari & Android Chrome.
Fix if not done: Make section full-bleed and keep an inner max-width wrapper.

<section className="w-screen bg-gradient-to-r from-[#6f3ef4] to-[#38bdf8] py-8">
  <div className="mx-auto max-w-7xl px-[clamp(12px,4vw,24px)]">
    <HeroCard/>
  </div>
</section>

2) Seller card content

 Logo/initial, store name, short bio/location visible.

 Status chips (payments, delivery, response time, verified) render on one line on desktop, wrap cleanly on mobile.

 Primary CTA Chat on WhatsApp; Secondary Create your store.
Evidence: Screenshot desktop + mobile.

3) Controls bar (below hero)

 Search input placeholder: “Search products, brands, or categories…”

 Category chips (All + categories) work.

 Sort dropdown (Newest first, Price, Popular).

 Favorites toggle (local) with count.

 Left/right padding visually aligns with hero card (not boxed).
Evidence: Screen recording scrolling from hero → controls.

4) Product grid & cards

 Grid is responsive (2–4 columns depending on width).

 Image uses fixed aspect ratio, object-fit: cover, lazy-loads.

 Title, 2-line truncated description, price “$X.XX per unit”.

 Badges (e.g., In Stock, New) render; no overflow.

 Desktop: WhatsApp button on hover. Mobile: button always visible.

 Empty state friendly when 0 items.
Evidence: Screenshots at ~360px, 768px, 1280px, 1440px.

5) WhatsApp behavior (must)

 Mobile opens WhatsApp app; Desktop opens WhatsApp Web in a new tab (store remains open).

 Prefilled message includes store name + product name + canonical link.

 URL encoded correctly (no broken characters).
How to implement:

const href = isMobileDevice()
  ? `https://wa.me/${e164}?text=${encodeURIComponent(msg)}`
  : `https://web.whatsapp.com/send?phone=${e164}&text=${encodeURIComponent(msg)}`;
window.open(href, isMobileDevice() ? '_self' : '_blank', 'noopener,noreferrer');


Evidence: Video from iPhone & desktop showing behavior.

6) Analytics events

 store_view fires once per visit (debounced).

 product_view fires on card visibility (IntersectionObserver, once per product per session).

 wa_click fires when WA button is clicked/tapped (includes productId).

 Events appear under /events/{sellerId}/....
Evidence: JSON export or screenshot from RTDB showing events.

7) Performance

 Mobile Lighthouse (throttled): LCP ≤ 2.0s, CLS < 0.1.

 All images specify width/height to avoid layout shift.

 No large unused JS/libs on public page.
Evidence: Lighthouse JSON attached.

8) Accessibility (a11y)

 Inputs have labels/aria-labels; keyboard focus rings visible.

 Contrast AA (≥4.5:1) for text on gradient and on cards.

 Respects prefers-reduced-motion.
Evidence: Axe/Accessibility report screenshot.

9) Responsive safety & safe areas

 Padding uses safe area on iOS:

padding-left: max(16px, env(safe-area-inset-left));
padding-right: max(16px, env(safe-area-inset-right));


 No clipped content on notched devices.
Evidence: iPhone screenshot with notches.

10) Favorites (local)

 Toggling favorite updates icon and Favorites(n) count.

 Favorites persist per user via localStorage key favorites_{sellerId}.
Evidence: Refresh page; state persists.

11) Routing & deep links

 Loading a direct /store/:sellerId URL renders without flicker/error.

 Back/forward navigation preserves search/filter state where feasible.
Evidence: Short screen capture.

12) Errors & empty states

 Graceful error UI on network failure (retry button).

 Skeleton loaders while products fetch.
Evidence: Simulate offline in DevTools; attach screenshot.

13) Console & network hygiene

 No console errors/warnings (Chrome, Safari, Firefox).

 No 404s for images or assets.
Evidence: DevTools log exports.

14) SEO / sharing basics

 <title> = Store Name | YourApp.

 Open Graph tags (og:title, og:description, og:image) for store page.
Evidence: View-source or DevTools Elements screenshot.

Quick “Not-Done → Fix” map (common issues)

Hero boxed: remove outer container; make section full-bleed; keep inner max-width wrapper.

Desktop WA opens same tab: force _blank + noopener.

Encoding issues in WA message: always encodeURIComponent(msg).

CLS spikes: add explicit width/height on images or CSS aspect-ratio.

No product_view events: add IntersectionObserver with {threshold: 0.5}; disconnect after first fire per card.

What the agent must deliver back

Checked checklist (this doc) with all items marked Done.

Screenshots/videos for hero, controls alignment, mobile/desktop WA flow, and accessibility report.

Lighthouse JSON (mobile) + DevTools console/network logs showing no errors.

RTDB events screenshot (store_view, product_view, wa_click).
