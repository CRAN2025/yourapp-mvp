Restore the previous full marketing landing page (only the landing files), keep all other recent changes

Goals

Bring back the comprehensive React landing page (hero, WhatsApp demo card, features, testimonials, pricing, FAQ, footer).

Do not rollback the workspace or touch Firebase config, auth, or /app/* routing.

Keep all recent fixes (storefront, public/private mirroring, hosting deploy setup).

What to do

Work on a short branch

Create a branch restore-landing-only.

When done, open a PR in Replit (or commit with a clear message).

Find the last “good” landing component

Search commit history and agent cards for any of these (case-insensitive):

file names: MarketLanding-Downloadable.tsx, MarketLanding.tsx, MarketingLanding.tsx

strings in code: "Launch a WhatsApp-ready storefront in minutes", "Create your free store", "WhatsApp-ready", "Start Free"

If Git is easier, look for the exact commit with:

git log -S "Create your free store" -- client/src

git log -- client/src/pages | head -n 50

then git show <SHA>:client/src/pages/<the-file>.tsx

Fallback: search the tarballs in repo (e.g., shoplink-final-deliverables.tar.gz, shoplink-evidence-complete.tar.gz) for the landing source. Extract only the landing file and related assets.

Restore the landing page without overwriting other code

If you find MarketLanding-Downloadable.tsx, copy it to:

client/src/pages/MarketingLanding.tsx

If a current landing file exists, back it up first as:

client/src/pages/MarketingLanding_backup_<date>.tsx

Ensure any referenced assets (images, svgs) are in place. If paths changed, update imports (e.g., /attached_assets → /client/src/assets or the current assets path).

Keep styling intact (Tailwind + any local CSS).

Wire the router

Make / use the restored component:

Example:

// client/src/router.tsx (or wherever routes are defined)
{ path: '/', element: <MarketingLanding /> }


Keep all existing /app/* routes unchanged.

All CTAs should go to:

Primary CTA: /app or /app/signup

Secondary “Sign in” link: /app/signin

Do not change firebase.json except ensure the SPA rewrites still include:

"rewrites": [{ "source": "**", "destination": "/index.html" }]


Build & quick verify (dev preview)

cd client && npm run build

Open Replit Preview in a new tab so the layout isn’t constrained.

Confirm:

Hero, features, testimonials, pricing, FAQ all render.

Images/icons load (no 404s in Network).

Buttons route to /app/auth pages and don’t break.

Keep hosting setup intact

Do not modify hosting target or project binding.

Do not touch rules or mirroring logic.

Guardrails

Do not rollback or revert unrelated files.

If the old landing imports any deprecated helpers, inline only what’s necessary within the landing component file.

No changes to auth/session logic or seller console.

No changes to store public view logic.

Deliverables

Files added/changed:

client/src/pages/MarketingLanding.tsx

(optional) any new asset files or updated import paths.

router file updated to point / → MarketingLanding

A short summary:

Which commit/tarball the landing was restored from (SHA or archive name).

Exact files touched (1–3 files max).

Screenshot/GIF of the landing top + the CTA flow to /app.

Commit message:

restore: bring back full marketing landing page; keep routing and hosting unchanged

Acceptance criteria

/ shows the full restored marketing page as before (design + copy).

“Create your free store” CTA opens /app (or /app/signup).

“Sign in” opens /app/signin.

No console errors, no broken images, Lighthouse layout looks normal in a full-width tab.

npm run build passes with no type errors.

Nothing else regressed (seller console/public store unaffected).

If you can’t locate the exact file via Git/agent cards, use the tarball fallback method above and restore just that page file + imports.
