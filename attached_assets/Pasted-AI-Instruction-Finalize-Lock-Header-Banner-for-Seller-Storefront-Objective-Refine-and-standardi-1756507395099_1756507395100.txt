AI Instruction — Finalize & Lock Header/Banner for Seller Storefront
Objective

Refine and standardize the header/banner area for the seller storefront to achieve a premium, reusable, token-driven design. This locked style will later be inherited by the buyer storefront for consistency.

Design Goals

Maintain consistent branding aligned with the landing page and CTA tokens.

Finalize alignment, gradients, and spacing.

Ensure tokens are reusable across seller and buyer storefronts.

Required Updates
1. Background & Gradient Consistency

Use the exact icy-blue gradient family already locked for the CTA and category pills.

Remove any reddish/grey overlay tones to keep a unified visual identity.

2. Store Logo / Avatar Container

Reduce logo container padding by 4px on all sides.

Apply subtle elevation using the same card-shadow token used for category pills:

box-shadow: 0 4px 12px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.08);


Lock a 1:1 aspect ratio (square) for logos to prevent distortion.

For non-square logos, scale and center-align vertically and horizontally.

3. Store Title & Subtitle Spacing

Decrease the vertical gap between:

Store Name → “Powered by ShopLynk” → Subtitle (“Online Store”).

New spacing: 4px between name → powered text, 2px between powered text → subtitle.

Match store name typography with locked H3 token:

font-size: 22px;
font-weight: 700;
color: #111827;

4. Payment & Delivery Badges

Use the same card style tokens as category pills:

Rounded corners: 12px.

Padding: 8px 16px.

Shadow: match category pills' locked token.

Background: solid white with a 1px neutral border.

Vertically align these badges with the baseline of the Back to Dashboard CTA for a perfectly balanced header row.

5. Back to Dashboard CTA

Do not modify the CTA tokens.

Ensure its baseline matches the badges and store title text alignment.

6. Responsive Behavior

Ensure smooth scaling across all breakpoints:

Desktop (≥1280px)

Maintain current proportions and spacing.

Tablet (768px–1279px)

Scale down store logo/avatar by 10%.

Reduce store title font-size from 22px → 20px.

Maintain horizontal alignment.

Mobile (≤767px)

Collapse payment/delivery badges into a two-column grid.

Scale down logo/avatar by 20%.

7. Tokenization Requirements

After completing the refinements, lock the following header tokens globally:

Token Name	Purpose	Usage Context
--header-bg-gradient	Background gradient	Header, banner
--store-logo-shadow	Avatar shadow elevation	Store logo/avatar container
--store-title-font	Store name styling	Title typography
--badge-card-style	Payment/Delivery cards	Category pills + badges
--header-spacing	Vertical & horizontal spacing	Global header padding
Governance

Do not modify product cards, category pills, filters, or favorites buttons.

Ensure all spacing, shadows, and colors are pulled from locked tokens to guarantee reusability.

After this, all headers across the app (seller + buyer storefronts) should automatically inherit these tokens.
