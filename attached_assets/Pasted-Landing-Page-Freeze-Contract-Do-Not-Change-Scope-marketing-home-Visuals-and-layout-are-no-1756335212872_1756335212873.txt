Landing Page — Freeze Contract (Do Not Change)

Scope: / (marketing home). Visuals and layout are now final. Only routing/auth logic elsewhere may change.

1) Header

Structure: 2 siblings inside the header’s inner container:

Left: text wordmark “ShopLynk”

Right: cluster = FAQ + Create Store

Alignment: Header inner container must share the exact same grid as the hero:

max-width: 1200px

Gutters: padding-inline: clamp(16px, 4vw, 28px) and padding-left/right: max(28px, env(safe-area-inset-*))

Outer <header> has vertical padding only (24px 0); no extra horizontal padding.

Wordmark (text, not image):

Single line (white-space: nowrap)

Typography locked: font-weight: 700–725, font-size: clamp(24px, 2.05vw, 30px), letter-spacing: -0.01em, line-height: ~1.05

Gradient locked: deep blue → azure (as currently shipped). Do not swap to a logo image or change colors/size/weight.

No runtime DOM surgery: Do not create/move header nodes in useEffect. Layout is defined in JSX only.

2) Hero Section

H1/Hero copy: All text, punctuation, capitalization, and line breaks are frozen.

Container/grid: Must remain aligned with header (see above). Do not change max-width, gutters, or margins.

Typography scale: Do not change font sizes/weights/letter-spacing for the hero title, subtitle, or badges.

3) Primary CTA (“Create your free store”)

Visuals: Keep current gradient, radius, shadow, and label exactly as shipped.

Placement & size: Do not move, resize, or restyle.

Only allowed change: Routing logic (auth/onboarding) behind the button; no visual change.

4) Footer (brand)

Text wordmark version only (no image), smaller scale; keep alignment and spacing as shipped.

Do not modify links, columns, or copy.

5) Theme & System

Fonts: Keep current stack (Inter/system). No new web-font downloads.

Colors, shadows, radii: Do not alter global tokens, gradients, or drop shadows used on this page.

Assets: Do not add/replace images, SVGs, or animations on this page.

6) Responsiveness & A11y (must remain unchanged)

Breakpoints and behavior at 1440 / 1024 / 768 / 390 px must render identically.

Header/hero left edges must match within ≤ 1px at all breakpoints.

Brand link tap target ≥ 44px height.

No text wrapping of the wordmark at any viewport.

CLS ≤ 0.05 for the page.

7) Engineering Guardrails

Do not change DOM order or class names used by the current CSS on /.

Do not introduce layout JS that mutates widths/padding on resize.

Any analytics or A/B hooks must be non-visual (no style overrides).

Acceptance checks (run on PR)

Pixel-diff (or Playwright) confirms header and hero containers share the same left/right edges (≤ 1px variance).

Wordmark is single line, same font metrics, same gradient.

CTA visual snapshot unchanged.

No new network requests (e.g., fonts/images) on /.

CLS ≤ 0.05.

Bottom line: The landing page’s visuals, layout, and copy are locked. Only behind-the-scenes routing/auth fixes are allowed; the UI must remain byte-for-byte identical in appearance.
