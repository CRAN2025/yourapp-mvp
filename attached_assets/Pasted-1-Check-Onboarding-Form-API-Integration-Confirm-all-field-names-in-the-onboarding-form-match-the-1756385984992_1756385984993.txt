1. Check Onboarding Form â†’ API Integration

Confirm all field names in the onboarding form match the API contract exactly (e.g., storeName vs. store_name).

Validate that the onboarding form sends the complete payload with all fields in the request body.

Check that the correct API endpoint is being used for saving seller profile data.

Verify the HTTP method used for saving is correct (POST, PUT, or PATCH as defined).

2. Check API Save Logic

Confirm the API accepts all the submitted fields and is not dropping any due to schema or whitelist restrictions.

Verify the API returns a success response (200/201) and persists the data in the database.

Log any validation errors or constraint failures (e.g., uniqueness on store name, invalid phone number).

Ensure the correct seller ID is used when saving data.

3. Check Database Layer

Confirm data is actually written to the correct seller record after onboarding submission.

Check for missing columns or mismatches between form fields and database schema.

Ensure there are no NOT NULL or length constraint errors preventing fields from saving.

4. Check Settings Page Data Fetch

Confirm the Settings page calls the correct GET endpoint for fetching seller profile data.

Make sure the Settings page maps API response fields correctly to the UI fields.

Check that the latest saved data appears after a hard refresh (clear any cached or stale state).

5. Media Fields (Logos/Banners)

If images are not displaying:

Verify the upload flow works and files reach storage successfully.

Confirm the image URLs are being saved in the database.

Ensure the Settings page renders the saved URLs properly.

6. Security & Authorization

Confirm that the auth token is included in save and fetch requests.

Verify that the signed-in seller has permission to update and fetch their own profile.

Check for any row-level security or tenant restrictions that may block updates or reads.

7. Common Causes to Check

Field name mismatches between form, API, and database.

API silently rejecting fields due to schema/validation rules.

Data being saved under the wrong seller ID or tenant.

Old or incorrect endpoint used by the Settings page.

Browser or app caching old data instead of fetching updated records.

Image uploads not persisting URLs to the DB.

Expected Outcome

After fixing, all fields saved during onboarding should display correctly on the Settings page immediately after refresh.

If a field fails to save, the system should show a clear error message instead of silently failing.
