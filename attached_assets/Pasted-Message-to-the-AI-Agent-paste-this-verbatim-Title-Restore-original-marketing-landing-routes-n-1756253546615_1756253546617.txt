Title: Restore original marketing landing & routes (no Firebase changes)

Goal: Put the original React marketing page back on /, keep all CTAs pointing to /app, and ensure styles/assets match the “MarketLanding-Downloadable” design. Do not change Firebase config in this task.

Steps:

Find the original landing component

Locate the downloadable/original marketing component (likely one of:
client/src/pages/MarketLanding-Downloadable.tsx, MarketLanding.tsx, or similar).

Create/restore a canonical page file at client/src/pages/MarketingLanding.tsx that renders the full design (hero with WhatsApp CTA, features, testimonials, pricing, FAQ, footer, etc.).

Ensure all images/icons used by this page live under client/public/assets and are referenced with root-relative paths (e.g. /assets/…) so they work in dev & production.

Route the landing page to /

In the router (e.g., client/src/main.tsx or client/src/router.tsx), set:

{ path: '/', element: <MarketingLanding /> }


Make no changes to /app/* routes. All “Create Store”, “Start Free”, and “Sign in” CTAs should navigate to /app (or the correct app entry if it’s /app/auth or /app/login—use the existing target used previously).

Remove the simplified placeholder

If there is a minimal placeholder landing component currently at /, replace it with the restored page.

Keep the app shell and any /app/* routes untouched.

Styling & responsiveness

Confirm Tailwind (or your CSS pipeline) includes all page globs:
tailwind.config.(js|ts) → content: ['client/index.html','client/src/**/*.{ts,tsx,js,jsx}']

Ensure the landing page wraps main content in a centered container, e.g.:
className="max-w-[1200px] mx-auto px-4 sm:px-6 lg:px-8".

Verify hero, feature grid, and testimonials look correct ≥1200px width and down to 320px.

Asset paths & SEO

Use root-relative asset paths (/assets/...) so both Vite dev (/) and Firebase hosting (also /) resolve correctly.

Keep index.html SEO tags intact; don’t remove the <div id="root"></div> or Vite’s script injection.

No Firebase changes in this task

Do not touch firebase.json, .firebaserc, or the hosting rewrites we added in the previous step. We’ll re-deploy after you finish.

Acceptance criteria

Opening / in dev shows the full original marketing page (not the simplified version).

All CTAs navigate to /app (or the existing app entry) and do not 404 in dev.

Opening the Replit preview in a new tab shows full-width layout without odd gutters.

Page looks identical (or visually equivalent) to the original “MarketLanding-Downloadable” design.
