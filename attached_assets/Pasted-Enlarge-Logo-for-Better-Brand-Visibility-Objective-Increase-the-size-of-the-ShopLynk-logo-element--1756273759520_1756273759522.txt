Enlarge Logo for Better Brand Visibility

Objective:
Increase the size of the ShopLynk logo element (top-left of the header) by 40–60% while preserving layout integrity, responsiveness, and accessibility.

Implementation Requirements

Locate the Logo Element

Identify the <img> or <svg> element representing the site logo.

Confirm it is the combined logo + title element.

Resize the Logo

Increase size by exactly 50% (midpoint of the 40–60% range) relative to its current rendered dimensions.

Maintain aspect ratio to avoid stretching or pixelation.

Ensure visual quality at 2x resolution for Retina/HiDPI screens.

Maintain Alignment

Keep logo vertically and horizontally aligned within the header.

Do not shift the adjacent “FAQ” and Create Store button positions.

Responsive Scaling

Test breakpoints:

Desktop: ≥1024px

Tablet: 768px–1023px

Mobile: ≤767px

Ensure the logo resizes proportionally at each breakpoint without overflowing or clipping.

Preserve Layout & Interactions

Verify the enlarged logo does not overlap navigation, buttons, or the “Create your free store” CTA.

Maintain existing hover effects, click events, and animations.

Accessibility Requirements

Confirm alt text is preserved or added if missing.
