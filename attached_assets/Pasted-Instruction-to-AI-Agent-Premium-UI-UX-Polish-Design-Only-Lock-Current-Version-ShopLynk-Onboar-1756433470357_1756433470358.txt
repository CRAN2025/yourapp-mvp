1. Product Card Design Refinements

Make the product cards premium, clean, and consistent across all categories.

A) Badge Styling

Unify badge backgrounds and text colors:

Badge Type	Background	Text Color	Icon
Stock Warning	#E63946	White, bold, ALL CAPS	⚠️ Always included
Sustainability	#DFF6E3	#2ECC71	✅ Leaf icon
Category/Subcategory	Dark neutral #212529	White	Keep same icon style
Features (Handmade, Customizable, Gift Wrap, Made-to-Order)	#F8F9FA	#444 muted	Use consistent neutral pastel icons
Attributes (Color, Size, Material)	Light gray #F1F3F5	Darker neutral text #333	Consistent attribute icons
B) Typography Rules

Use sentence case across all labels:

✅ “Eco-friendly”

✅ “One Size”

✅ “Limited Stock — Only 10 Left”

❌ “eco friendly”, “one size”, “limited stock — only 10 left”

Use consistent font sizes:

Product Name → Slightly larger than badges

Price → Bold + green #27AE60

Badges → Smaller, consistent across all types.

C) Badge Layout & Spacing

All badges must:

Be perfectly aligned horizontally.

Use equal vertical padding.

Center icons and text visually.

Max badges per row: 3

Max badges per card: 4 (primary attributes only)

Prioritize: Color → Size → Material → Sustainability

Push all secondary badges like Gift Wrapping, Made-to-Order, Customizable to View Details only.

D) “View Details” Button Styling

Current button blends into the background → make it more visually distinct:

White button with a soft border: #E0E0E0

Slight shadow: box-shadow: 0px 2px 5px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.05)

Rounded corners to match card edges.

On hover: subtle shadow lift + darker text color.

E) Card Layout Enhancements

Add soft shadows for premium polish:

box-shadow: 0px 4px 12px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.08);
border-radius: 14px;


Maintain consistent padding around edges:

Top → 16px

Bottom → 16px

Sides → 14px

2. Product Details Page Refinements

Group related info visually into clean sections:

Top Section: Product Name, Brand, Price, Category/Subcategory, Limited Stock badge.

Attributes Section: Color, Size, Material, Sustainability.

Special Features Section: Handmade, Customizable, Gift Wrapping, Made-to-Order.

Product Policies Section: Warranty, Return Policy, Care Instructions, Ships From, Personalization.

Occasion & Age Group Section: Show if provided.

Use the same badge style rules from product cards for visual consistency.

3. Seller Console Product View

Display all fields entered in a clean, grouped layout:

Inventory & Pricing: Price, Quantity in Stock.

Classification: Category, Subcategory.

Attributes: Size, Color, Material.

Features: Handmade, Customizable, Gift Wrapping, Made-to-Order.

Policies: Care Instructions, Warranty, Return Policy.

Additional Details: Sustainability, Occasion, Age Group.

Match badge styling with the public view for a cohesive design.

4. Rules for Implementation

Design-Only Change → Do not alter data fetching, routing, or backend logic.

Ensure mobile-first responsive design:

Cards adapt perfectly on mobile, tablet, and desktop.

Maintain consistent spacing, typography, and color palette across all product categories.

5. Testing Requirements

Before finalizing, verify:

Badges are styled consistently across all products and categories.

Font sizes and capitalization are uniform.

Product cards, seller console, and details page look identical in:

✅ Desktop view

✅ Tablet view

✅ Mobile view

“View Details” button visually separates from the card background.

Secondary badges move successfully into View Details without breaking layout.
