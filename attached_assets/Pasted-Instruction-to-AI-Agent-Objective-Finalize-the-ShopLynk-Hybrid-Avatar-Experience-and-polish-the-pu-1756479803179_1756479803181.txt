Instruction to AI Agent

Objective: Finalize the ShopLynk Hybrid Avatar Experience and polish the public storefront header to a global marketplace standard.

1. Avatar Upgrade (Seller + ShopLynk Fallback)
Logic

If seller uploads logo/avatar → Display uploaded logo (centered, circular).

If no avatar uploaded → Use /assets/logos/shoplynk-logo.svg (ShopLynk’s gradient logo).

If low-resolution avatar (< 200x200px) → Auto-upscale and wrap in subtle shadow (max blur 8px).

Styling

Size: 88px × 88px

Shape: Perfect circle.

Border: 1px solid rgba(229, 231, 235, 0.5) (light neutral stroke).

Shadow: Ultra-soft glow → 0 4px 14px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.06)

Hover effect: Slight scale(1.03) with smooth ease-out transition.

2. “Powered by ShopLynk” Badge (Premium Treatment)
Placement

Below store name.

Left-aligned, same baseline as store title.

Design

Badge content:
[ShopLynk Icon] Powered by ShopLynk

Icon source: /assets/logos/shoplynk-icon.svg

Icon size: 14px × 14px

Typography:

Font: Inter

Size: 12px

Weight: 500

Color: #6B7280 (neutral gray).

Hover: Subtle fade-in opacity effect to highlight interactivity.

3. Header Gradient & Composition

Keep the current light-to-transparent gradient (top-left → bottom-right).

Reduce opacity of the header background from 100% to 92% for a lighter, airier effect.

Maintain 24px vertical padding inside header for breathing space.

Ensure alignment matches the filter/search bar width precisely — edge-to-edge consistency.

4. Unification of Visual Identity

We’ll integrate the ShopLynk gradient branding into fallback elements for cohesiveness:

Fallback avatar → ShopLynk gradient logo instead of solid blue.

Button hover glow → ShopLynk gradient at linear-gradient(135deg, #4F46E5 0%, #6366F1 100%).

Search bar focus state → Subtle gradient border using ShopLynk colors.

5. Governance & Locks

LOCKED: Product cards → v1.3.1_UI_UX_WHATSAPP_PER_CARD

LOCKED: Seller console → v1.7_SELLER_CONSOLE_PREMIUM_POLISH

LOCKED: WhatsApp CTA routing & deep links → Reserved for v1.9.4

This applies only to the public storefront header.

Key Outcomes

Premium Visual Consistency → ShopLynk branding subtly present without overpowering seller individuality.

Global E-commerce Standard → Matches Shopify, Etsy, and Stripe aesthetics.

Scalable Branding Strategy → Ensures ShopLynk stays visually trusted while empowering sellers.
