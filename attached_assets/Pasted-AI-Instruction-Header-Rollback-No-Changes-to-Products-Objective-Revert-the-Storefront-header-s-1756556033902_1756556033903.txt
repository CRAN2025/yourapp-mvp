AI Instruction — Header Rollback (No Changes to Products)
Objective

Revert the Storefront header (seller view within console) and Public Store header (buyer view) to the previously locked baseline while keeping the product section unchanged.

Scope

In scope

Seller Storefront page header (within console shell)

Public Store header (buyer view)

Token usage and visual consistency

Out of scope

Product cards, tags, badges, stock banners, buttons

Filters, search, sorting, favorites

Pagination and data fetching

What to Change
1) Replace current headers with the locked component

Use the previously approved header spec:

Layout

Background: var(--surface/elevated) with var(--elevation/2) shadow.

Container: respect the console grid, not edge-to-edge.

max-width: var(--container/content-width); (locked to 1200px)

margin: 0 auto;

padding: var(--space/5) var(--space/6);

Left block

Store Logo: 64px (tokenized)

width/height: var(--brand/logo-size); = 64px

Rounded 16px or brand-default

Store Name: bold, single line

“Powered by ShopLynk” secondary label under name

Description: dynamic (from store profile), fallback to
“Maybe there was no description here before”
(use subtle text color token)

Right block (seller storefront only)

Pills (neutral):

6 Payment Methods

4 Delivery Options

Primary CTA (gradient-blue):

Back to Dashboard

Remove:

View Public Store (obsolete)

Edit Store (not approved)

Public store (buyer)

Same header visuals (logo/name/powered-by/description)

No pills, no buttons (no seller controls)

Same container width/padding as seller header for consistency.

2) Enforce the token system (locked values)
Element	Token	Value
Logo size	--brand/logo-size	64px
Primary CTA height	--cta/primary/height	40px
Pill radius	--chip/pill/radius	20px
Pill padding X	--chip/pill/padding-x	12px
Container max width	--container/content-width	1200px
Surface color	--surface/elevated	(theme default)
Shadow	--elevation/2	(theme default)
Subtle text	--text/subtle-color	(theme default)
Spacing (outer)	--space/5 / --space/6	(theme default)

Important: No one-off CSS that overrides these tokens. The header must render identically in both views (minus seller-only actions).

3) Governance / Cleanup

Remove the View Public Store button from seller header.

Remove the Edit Store button from seller header.

Ensure public store header does not show any actions.

Ensure the header aligns with console header and page shell (no edge-to-edge header panel).

Keep the “Back to Dashboard” CTA styling exactly as previously locked (gradient, height, radius).

File/Component Hints (adapt to your codebase)

SellerStorefrontHeader.tsx / StorefrontHeader.vue → replace with locked header component

PublicStoreHeader.tsx / BuyerHeader.vue → reuse same component; hide actions via mode="buyer"

tokens.css / theme.css → ensure tokens above exist and are not locally overridden

Remove any temporary “blue full-width header” variant styles

Acceptance Criteria

Seller Storefront header (inside console) shows:

Logo 64px, Name, Powered by, Description (with fallback text)

Pills: 6 Payment Methods, 4 Delivery Options

Primary CTA: Back to Dashboard

No “View Public Store”, no “Edit Store”

Header panel width matches console content grid (not edge-to-edge)

Public Store header (buyer) shows:

Logo 64px, Name, Powered by, Description

No pills, no CTAs

Identical sizing, spacing, and alignment to seller header

Tokens are used. No inline hardcoded sizes. Shared tokens govern both seller and buyer.

No regressions in:

Product cards, CTAs, badges

Filters, search, favorites

Stock banners (e.g., “LIMITED STOCK”)
