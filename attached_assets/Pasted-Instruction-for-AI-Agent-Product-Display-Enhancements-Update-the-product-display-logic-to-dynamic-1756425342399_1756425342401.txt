Instruction for AI Agent — Product Display Enhancements

Update the product display logic to dynamically include these fields wherever a value exists.
Implement across three places:

Seller Console Product View

Public Product Card (summary)

Public Product Details (full view)

1. Seller Console → Product View

Goal: The seller must see everything they entered for easy verification.
Rule: If the field has a value → display it.

Fields to Show (If Value Exists):

Product Images (already shown)

Product Name

Price

Quantity in Stock ✅ (missing now — must add)

Category

Subcategory ✅ (missing now — must add)

Description

Brand

Condition

Size

Color

Material

Handmade (icon badge if selected)

Customizable (icon badge if selected)

Style

Occasion

Ships From

Personalization Options ✅ (missing now — must add)

Care Instructions ✅ (missing now — must add)

Return Policy

Seller Expectation:
Everything they enter in Edit Product should be fully visible here.

2. Public Product Card → First Screen

Rule: Display these if a value exists:

Always Show on Card:

4. Implementation Rules

Show if Value Exists: For optional fields, do not display placeholders — only show fields if the seller entered data.

Badge vs. Detail:

On cards → badges only for color, size, material, handmade, customizable

In details → show full descriptions

Consistency: Keep iconography, font sizes, and alignment consistent across seller view, public cards, and details view.

5. Priorities for Missing Fields

The following must be added across the three views:

Field	Seller Console	Public Card	Public Details
Quantity in Stock	✅ Add	⚠️ Show Low Stock Badge	✅ Show full
Subcategory	✅ Add	✅ Add	✅ Add
Personalization	✅ Add	❌ Skip on Card	✅ Add
Care Instructions	✅ Add	❌ Skip on Card	✅ Add
Sustainability	✅ Add	❌ Skip on Card	✅ Add
Warranty	✅ Add	❌ Skip on Card	✅ Add
Occasion & Style	✅ Add	❌ Skip on Card	✅ Add
