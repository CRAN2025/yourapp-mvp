## Enhanced Change Workflow (Technical Instructions)

### Step 1: Confirm Lock Status
When any change is requested to onboarding/settings flows:

**REQUIRED RESPONSE**: 
> "Onboarding/Settings flows are LOCKED per governance protocol. Starting v[X.Y]_[TAG]. **Confirm explicit unlock approval?**"

**DO NOT START** unless Senait explicitly approves with "UNLOCK APPROVED"

### Step 2: Versioning Rules
**Naming Convention**: `ShopLynk_Onboarding_Settings_v<MAJOR>.<MINOR>_<TAG>`

**Version Types**:
- `v1.1_FIX` - Bug fixes and corrections
- `v1.2_UI` - Visual/UX improvements only  
- `v1.3_UPDATE` - Minor feature updates
- `v2.0_FEATURE` - New functionality or major changes
- `v[X.Y]_LOCKED` - Stable, tested, approved version

### Step 3: Create New Version Branch
Before any modifications:
1. Clone the last stable version (`v1.0_LOCKED`)
2. Name the new working version appropriately 
3. Work only within the new version scope
4. Document all changes in this log

### Step 4: Implementation & Quality Gates
**Required Testing Before Lock**:
- ✅ Smoke test: Landing → Onboarding Step 1 → Seller Console
- ✅ Settings sync validation
- ✅ Currency & phone format validation
- ✅ No loops, blank pages, or broken states
- ✅ Firebase data persistence verification
- ✅ Route guard behavior testing

### Step 5: Version Locking
If stable and approved:
1. Tag as: `ShopLynk_Onboarding_Settings_v[X.Y]_[TAG]_LOCKED`
2. Update Master Change Log with completion
3. Provide version ID back to Senait
4. Archive working version, maintain locked baseline

### Step 6: Rollback Protocol (IMMEDIATE)
**Triggers**: Any regression in core functionality
**Action**: Restore → `ShopLynk_Onboarding_Settings_v(last_stable)_LOCKED`
**Required**: Log rollback details immediately, notify Senait
